Smart-Waste-Management-System
Problems:
        Over flowing of dustbin.
        Inappropriate Waste Management.
        People not concerned with their duties.
        Lack of dustbins at a particular place.

Proposed System provide an IT based solution to garbage collection providing greater accessibility, planning appropriately fordisposing process and at the same time enabling collection of garbage generation data. This proposed system solves three related problems:

        Greater access to the garbage disposing points(public dustbin).
        Efficient in terms of time and fuel cost.
        Provide data collection facility on how much a city generates garbage and accordingly plan disposing process.

Objectives

        To develop a smart dustbin using ESP 8266 module and ultrasonic sensor.
        To develop an automated system decreases the work load of human regarding the cleanliness of the environment.

Methodology

The methodology will be adopted as follows:

        In order to find out if the dustin is filled or not, we can use various sort of sensors such as IR sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor and Weight sensors. In the project, the sensor used is Ultrasonic sensor.

        Some of the other instrumentation utilized in the project is Arduino, Jumper wires(male and female), GSM/ESP 8266(Wi-Fi module), Battery*, Dust Bin, Arduino holder, etc.

        We have placed the ultrasonic sensor on the top of dustbin where the ultrasonic waves can interact to the garbage inside the dustbin.

        The ultrasonic sensor will send data and tell the Arduino regarding the amount oof garbage in the dustbin.

        And the Arduino will upload the data captured by Ultrasonic Sensor to Firebase which is an Data storage for our Android application.

        Android application will fetch the data uploaded by ultrasonic sensor from our data storage that is Firebase.

        The concern person would be having the application to see the data sent by ultrasonic sensor.

        Though the person would know when to change or clear the dustbin.

Result

        The result we are going to recieve would be the processed data of the Arduino attached to the dustbin.
        The result would be displayed on the phone of the concerned person.
        This project will also result into a better and clean environment.
        This project will also lead to a better coordination in cleanliness system of small campuses.
        This project will lead to a environment where distance between human and technology would be less.
